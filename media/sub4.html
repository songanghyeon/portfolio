									<li>Formed in the form of orange and black striped domes, the Bumble Gorge is located in Punululu National Park, and is just as beautiful as its unique shape. Never miss this attraction, which symbolizes the Kimberley area of Western Australia.</li>
									<li>The Bungle Gorge in Punululu National Park, which is listed as a World Heritage Site, is Kimberly's most famous symbol. When viewed from the sky, it looks like a giant rock dome unexpectedly rose on the dusty savanna plains. It also looks like a beehive with bands of indigo bacteria. Ancient palm trees stand out of place, and isolated pools of water remain dry until the dry season when the sun blows. Perhaps it is Australia's most prominent, surrealistic terrain.</li>

										<li>Punululu National Park is 300 km south of Kununura, which requires four-wheel drive to travel or fly. Fly to Kununura Airport from many cities in Australia. When you arrive at the airport, it takes you three hours to drive to Punulu National Park, 287 km south.</li>
										<li>Driving around is the most efficient, but there are also walking courses ranging from short walking courses to overnight walking courses.</li>

									<li>The best time to visit Punululu National Park is during the dry season. During the wet season, the park is closed and only airplane tours are operated. The park is usually open between April 1 and December 1 but may vary depending on the climate and precipitation during the wet season.</li>
									<li>If you want to camp by choosing a cooler season (April to August), make sure to prepare a sleeping bag thick enough to withstand the cold under 0°C (32°F).Temperatures can rise to 50°C (122°F) during the warm season (October to December), so please take the right precautions to avoid heat stroke.</li>

									<li>There are endless opportunities for adventure in Litchfield National Park.
										A short drive from Darwin, Richfield is considered the Northern Territory's most secretive location. Thanks to its various experiences, including swimming under a misty waterfall, viewing unusual termite graves, exploring several water holes, and hiking trails, you'll never get bored on this epic national park trip.</li>
									<li>Staying overnight in the park requires using camping, but if you don't prefer camping, you can use accommodations near the park. If you plan well, you can create unforgettable memories even on a day trip.</li>

										<li>Located just 90 minutes away from Darwin is the entrance to Richfield National Park. The most common way to see the area is by self-driving. Though not required, all routes in the park are available if you drive a four-wheel-drive car. If you don't prefer to drive, you can take advantage of the daily day tours in Darwin.</li>
										<li>Darwin International Airport (DRW) is 105 km away, about a 90-minute drive from Richfield National Park, with both international and domestic flights operating.
											Rent-a-car is available at Darwin Airport. If you want to rent a four-wheel-drive car, you'd better make a reservation in advance.</li>

									<li>Similar to Darwin, Richfield National Park has two seasons: dry season (May-October) and wet season (November-April). The dry season, when most roads and swimming spots are open, is the most popular visiting time, as roads may be closed during the wet season.</li>

									<li>Tasmania's majestic mountains are an indispensable place for wildland adventures.
										With its dramatic soaring peaks, glacier-cut lakes, unique-looking meadows and pristine rainforests, it is the Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park.</li>
									<li>Located within the wildlands of Tasmania, a World Heritage Site, Cradle Mountain offers world-class hiking, unique wildlife experiences, and a true connection with nature.</li>

										<li>The easiest way to get to Cradle Mountain-St. Clare Lake National Park is by car. There are two main gates to the park, one to the north and the other to the south. The north gate is a two-and-a-half-hour drive from Launceston, and the south gate is a two-and-a-half-hour drive from Hobart. There is no direct connection between the north and south gates.</li>
										<li>Shuttle buses are operated in the park, and private vehicles are prohibited during shuttle operation hours (summer: 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., winter: 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.).
											Visitors are encouraged to park at the Cradle Mountain Visitor Center.</li>

									<li>The climate in Cradle Mountain-St. Clare Lake National Park can be a bit unpredictable. However, the temperature is mild in the summer and it is normal to have light snowfall in the winter. Summer and fall are great seasons to hike along hiking trails.</li>
									<li>There are several access roads into Cradle Mountain and some are closed in winter, so be sure to check in advance before you set off by car.</li>
